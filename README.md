# Tic-Tak-Toe

 Overview:
This app is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game where two players take turns placing "X" and "O" on a 3x3 grid.

 How It Works:

1. Intro Screen:
   - When you open the app, it shows a splash screen for 3 seconds.

2. Player Setup:
   - After the splash screen, you go to a setup screen where you can enter the names of the two players.
   - You have buttons to either reset the screen or start the game with the names you entered.

3. Tic-Tac-Toe Game:
   - The main game screen has a 3x3 grid of buttons.
   - Players take turns clicking on the buttons to place their mark: Player 1 is "X" and Player 2 is "O".
   - The game keeps track of whose turn it is and checks for a winner after each move.

4. Winning and Drawing:
   - The game checks if either player has three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal.
   - If a player wins, a message shows the winner.
   - If all spots are filled and there’s no winner, it’s a draw.

5. Result Screen:
   - After a win or a draw, the app shows a screen displaying the result.
   - You can play again by clicking a button to go back and start over.

 Special Features:

- The app adapts to fit your device screen, extending into the status and navigation bars for a full-screen experience.
- Background images change based on whether the winner is "X", "O", or if it’s a draw.
